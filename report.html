    <h2>PMI</h2>
    <p>your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
    <p><strong>Pluses: <li>Regular team meeting.  </li>
    <li>2 group members (Pranali and )are good in development and designing  </li>
    <li> other group members are good in connent selection, image selection etc.  </li>
    <li>Simple design and user friendly is the plus point of website   </li>
    <li>Easy to understand ,navigation bar of the website explains everything which is easy to understand the website.  </li></strong>
    <p>We started work on project as per our plan schedule. and finished design and structure in week 7. We started our project acccording to plan which is a plus point for us because we can managed to finish it on time. The website having sliding images and less content because of that user can understand better the wesite information. The website goal is eaily implemented with its simple though attractive design.This website gives the appropriate information to new user and current users. Images and videos helps to describe more about Townville music academy. </p></p>
    <p><strong>Minuses: The website is dynamic , it only shows the information to the new user and current user. Inside the contact page there is enquiry form which is static. Users only can see the enquiry form but in reality they can't send enquriy with this website.</strong> The other minus point is we decided the different structure for website but at he time of implementation of website , Our final structure is different. The other minus point of website is we have limitation  of data and images because of that we didn't use ouside of old townsville data. <li> We tried to do contact us page dynamic but because of lack of knowlege and limited time period we failed to do that.</li> We decide to include amp into the website but we failed to implement it.</p>
    <p><strong>Interesting: The images in the website, video , content of website and navigation bar with overall flow of website helps to fullfil our goal of websitewhich is  to promote the Australian music and represents the various kinds of music styles in Townsville Academy and to give platform to local musicians and give them chance to perform at various theaters. Client who will explore our website, would know about the next upcoming events and can also become member of this music academy. </strong> The interesting fact at the time of developing website is we need more time to develop the layout and structure of the website. After making structure we finished our rest of the website within 2 weeks in that 2 weeks we learn marquee , javascript, responsive , css , video options and many more new concepts.</p>
